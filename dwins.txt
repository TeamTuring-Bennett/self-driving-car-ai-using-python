-- INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE DRAWING WINDOW -- 

1) Use the mouse to Draw as you would normally in applications like Paint. Note that only one color is currently
available for drawing the track, as adding more would result in a confusionn between the AI and the track.

2) The track has an autocomplete feature, you can leave a bit of gap between the start and ends of your track.
Bear in mind that this only works if the last line you draw is the one that is closest to the beginning of the track.
Messing with the order of building can greatly harm the end product.

3) For the above mentioned reason, a Start Over button has been added. This allows you to instantly start the building
process over from scratch.

4) The "Save Track" Button exports the track you have made as a PNG. This is important because the AI reads tracks as a PNG.

5) All tracks must have a designated starting line. Save track will not work until one has been made.

6) Try not to have any overlapping pieces of track, the track will save as an image, and has no concept of height or depth.

7) Have fun creating the tracks!
